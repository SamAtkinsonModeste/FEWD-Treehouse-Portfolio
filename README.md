**Using all the knowledge I have learnt throughout my techdegree, I have gone through the process of creating a mockup and then bringing the mockup to life through code.**

Users should be able to:

- A mobile-first approach is utilized using min-width properties for media queries.
- Click through a carousel of my projects
- Learn a little about myself

#### Exceeds Requiremnts

- **Exceeds**: Add another breakpoint for tablet sized screens..
- **Exceeds**: Links to more than 4 projects.
- **Exceeds**: Use SVG images for icons.
- **Exceeds**: More than one example of JavaScript interactivity, that is triggered by an event.

## My Process

As I wanted to create my own **SVG**s, I started experimenting with Illustrator.<br>
I moved on to creating mockups of mobile,tablet and desktop in Adobe XD.<br>
For the coding process I followed my mockups and with Adobe XD able to gain some of the code for fonts and colours. ðŸ˜€

### Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- SVG
- JavaScript
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) - Javascript Animation library
- Illustrator
- Photoshop
- Adobe XD
- Favicon [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) - The Favicon Generator App where I upload my created favicon

### What I Learned

I gained a better understanding of _CSS Grid_ and more confidence with _JavaScript_.
I learnt that for my _GSAP_ animation to run, I had to add the values in quote marks so my animation ran with every click.

### Continued Development

Learning and using a Javascript framework such as React.

- [Rohlad von Merode](https://teamtreehouse.com/rohald89) also at Treehouse introduced me to GSAP , which I so love. He has been my soundboard for many things and a great support. Very grateful to all he has done for me.

Hopefully I have made them both proud with my portfolio.
